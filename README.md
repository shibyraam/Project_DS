### Ph Value
6.5–8.5
The pH of most drinking-water lies within the range 6.5–8.5. Natural waters can be of lower pH, as a result of, for example, acid rain or higher pH in limestone areas. The pH of an aqueous sample is usually measured electrometrically with a glass electrode.

### Hardness
Below 75 mg/L - is generally considered soft. 76 to 150 mg/L - moderately hard. 151 to 300 mg/L - hard.

### Solids
The higher the TDS, the more minerals are dissolved in the water. The World Health Organization (WHO) sets out guidelines for drinking water quality that include the recommendation that water with TDS below 300 PPM is considered safe for drinking. However, most authorities accept 500 PPM.

### Chloramines
Chloramine levels up to 4 milligrams per liter (mg/L) or 4 parts per million (ppm) are considered safe in drinking water. At these levels, harmful health effects are unlikely to occur.

### Sulfate
To be safe, only use water with a sulfate level lower than 500 milligrams per liter (mg/L) to make infant formula. Older children and adults may get used to high sulfate levels after a few days.

### Conductivity
The conductivity of drinking water is 200 to 800 μS/cm

### Organic_carbon
The water quality criteria for total organic carbon are 2 mg/L for treated water and 4 mg/L for source water. The criteria should not be exceeded at any time in drinking water systems that use chlorination for disinfection.

### Trihalomethanes
Monitoring and analysis of water quality parameters and THMs levels in drinking water treatment plants revealed that the average values (306.5 μg/L) exceeded the recommended US EPA guidelines of 80 μg/L.

### Turbidity
Turbidity should ideally be kept below 1 NTU because of the recorded impacts on disinfection. This is achievable in large well-run municipal supplies, which should be able to achieve less than 0.5 NTU before disinfection at all times and an average of 0.2 NTU or less, irrespective of source water type and quality.

### Potability
Potable water is the water which is filtered and treated properly and is finally free from all contaminants and harmful bacteria. This purified water is fit to drink, or it can be called 'drinking water after the purification processes and is safe for both cooking and drinking.
